Gemini 2.5 Pro
Claude 4.5 Sonnet
etc...

Each trial MUST be individually scored on a new, fresh, temporary/no memory chat to prevent:

1. Serial position effect (kicks in after 5-7 evaluations)

2. Anchoring bias (appears after ~3 exposures with feedback).

3. Fatigue effects (likely not applicable with AI judges).
